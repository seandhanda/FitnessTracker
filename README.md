## Project Description

Our project centers around developing a health and fitness/progress tracking application. 
In this domain, we are creating a comprehensive fitness app that empowers users to design workouts, 
monitor goal achievements, and schedule sessions with gym trainers. 

The database encompasses user profiles, workout plans, exercise details, progress tracking, trainer appointments, 
and facilitates social interaction, enabling users to share their fitness statistics and achievements with friends.
